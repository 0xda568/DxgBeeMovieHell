## What is this?
A Windows kernel mode driver that whites out the screen and obliterates it with the entire beemovie script by hooking a directx function.

## Why?
This is my first Kernel Mode driver project, in which I practice using basic undocumented structs and functions in the Windows kernel. I used many resources from the game cheat development branche resulting in a kernel mode driver that uses Windwos GDI functions to manipulate the GUI.
